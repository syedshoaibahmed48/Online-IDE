# Online IDE - Collaborative Code Editor and Execution Platform

- The Online IDE is a powerful web-based platform designed to provide developers with a collaborative code editing and execution environment for multiple programming languages from a web browser.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Collaborate with team members or colleagues in real-time, allowing multiple users to work on the same code simultaneously.

- **Code Execution**: Execute your code, supporting multiple programming languages and providing instant feedback on the output.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enjoy syntax highlighting to make your code more readable and visually appealing.

- **Project Management**: Organize and manage your projects with ease, creating, updating, and deleting projects as needed.

- **User Authentication**: Ensure secure access to the platform through user authentication, protecting user accounts and project data.

- **Error Handling**: Receive detailed error messages and diagnostics to identify and resolve coding issues quickly.
